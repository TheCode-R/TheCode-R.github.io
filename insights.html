      <h3>Why Most Dashboards Fail to Influence Decisions</h3>
      <p>
        Dashboards often fail not because of missing data, but because
        they are not designed around decisions leaders actually make.

      <h3>Metrics That Matter as D2C Brands Scale</h3>
      <p>
        As complexity increases, founders must reduce the number of
        metrics they rely on — not increase them.

      <h3>From Reporting to Decision Systems</h3>
      <p>
        Analytics should evolve from passive reporting to actively
        enabling confident, repeatable decisions.
