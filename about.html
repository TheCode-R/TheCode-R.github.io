    <p class="lead">
      Fortify was created to bring certainty to business decisions.
    </p>

    <p>
      After a decade of working across analytics, growth, and operations,
      it became clear that most organizations had access to data,
      but not clarity.
    </p>

    <p>
      Fortify focuses on building analytics dashboards that leaders
      can trust, adopt, and rely on — without noise or over-engineering.
    </p>

      <li>Deep exposure to D2C and consumer businesses</li>
